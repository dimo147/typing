We all know that health is wealth.
With its intricate network of bones, muscles, and organs, a well-functioning
human body is much like an orchestrated symphony.
To keep this orchestra playing well, we need physical exercise.
It may take the form of sports, yoga, or even regular walking.
It is well-known that people who engage in physical exercise stay happier and live longer.
Our society is turning towards more and more technical sophistication and automation.
The machine has replaced our physical labor.
To compensate for this change in lifestyle we need physical exercise.
Exercise also sharpens our intellect.
It keeps a balance between our body and mind.
With the help of regular physical training, we will stay healthier, happier, and more alert.
However, over-exercise or exercising in an improper way may tell upon our health and growth.
We must therefore do it in a balanced form.
