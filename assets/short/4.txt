Human life is a mixture of weal and woe, smiles and tears.
However, once what had seemed to be a memorable day turned to be the saddest day of my life.
We had planned for a picnic with all our classmates after the examination on the bank of the river Ganga.
We started early in the morning and reached at 10 am.
After the cooking was completed, we wished to take a bath in the Ganga.
Our class teacher warned that only those who knew swimming would be allowed to bathe in the river.
Rajesh, our youngest classmate, did not know how to swim.
But he came unnoticed and tried to imitate us in the river.
And what was feared happened? Rajesh was drowned. After a long search, we recovered the body.
The sight made us dumb and tears trickled down our cheeks.
The horrible sight still haunts me whenever I am alone.
