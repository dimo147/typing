Early men did not know how to grow food and use fire.
Now we are totally dependent on the gifts of Science.
Science had made our life easier and enjoyable with vehicles, TV, radio, telephones,
lights, media, computers, etc. Space flight is another wonder of science.
Thus through the gifts of science, a man who had once lived in the cave has now landed on the moon.
Yet there are some abuses of science.
It has given us the frightful nuclear weapons that can destroy the whole world.
But science cannot be blamed for this.
We can use fire for cooking our food or burning otherâ€™s houses.
It is not the fault of fire, but of its users.
Likewise, man is responsible for the uses and abuses of science.
