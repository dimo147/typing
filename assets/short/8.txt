We live in an age of science and feel its influence at every step of our life.
In fact, science has civilized man.
Early men did not know how to grow food and use fire.
Now we are totally dependent on the gifts of science.
The alarm clock wakes us and science has made our lives more enjoyable with radio, TV, light, fan,
refrigerator, etc. Vehicles carry us to distant places in a short time.
Telephones have improved communication.
We can get the benefit of modern drugs or surgery which are the products of science.
When we get bored, we can enjoy a cinema.
The newspaper or TV has brought the whole world into our drawing rooms.
The computer, the greatest gift of the 20th century, has relieved
man from manual and mental labor to a great extent.
